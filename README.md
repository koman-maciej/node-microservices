# Node Microservices

Node Microservices (do not kid yourself) is a next one, ordinary and boorish JavaScript application based on node.js runtime environment.
It's a simple example of using scripting language for developing microservices to make practice of scaling applications and continuous deployment with zero downtime. This one should be used to hotel reservation management, but I truly do not recommend using it in real environment.

## Prerequisites

- [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) - for version control
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - runtime for JavaScript
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) - dependency management

## Get started

- Choose your favourite text editor for develop
- Install dependencies via `npm install`
- Run each microservice by typing e.g.: `nodejs customer/customer`


## Important

You can use this application at your own risk. I would be glad to see any bug reporting, contribution, improvement requests to make Node Microservices less depressing.
